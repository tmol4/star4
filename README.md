> [!WARNING]
> Since the library is in active development, many developer-friendly and organizational features are not yet present, for example:
> - **Documentation website**:\
> *It takes great time to build a docs website for a multi-framework library, you know?*
> - **Documentation comments**:\
> *Unstable APIs may change frequently, so we would have to rewrite JSDoc comments without a break.*
> - **Examples**:\
> *Projects in the [examples](examples) directory are actively used during development, but they do not yet serve as actual example projects.*
> - **Development pipeline**
> - **Developer workflow**
